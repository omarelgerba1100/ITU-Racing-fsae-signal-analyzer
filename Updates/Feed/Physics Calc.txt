The well-known American author, Bill Bryson, once said: “Physics is really nothing more than a search for ultimate simplicity, but so far all we have is a kind of elegant messiness.” Physics is indeed the most fundamental of the sciences that tries to describe the whole nature with thousands of mathematical formulas. How not to get lost in all of this knowledge? How to organize it? The solution is here! Our physicists’ team constantly create physics calculators, with equations and comprehensive explanations that cover topics from classical motion, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism to astrophysics and even quantum mechanics. Whether you need a kinematics calculator, dynamics calculator, density calculator, or gear ratio calculator, we’ve got you covered!
